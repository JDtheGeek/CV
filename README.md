# John Dennehy

When my wife told her friends I was leaving my job in the finance sector to learn to code, they were suprised, as they assumed I already worked in the tech industry. I have always loved technology, from my first computer (Amiga 500), to building my own PCs, to my first job teaching the elderly to use MS Office.

## Skills

#### Clear, Concise Communication
- Communicating complex ideas and concepts in plain english. This was demonstrated by thank-you letters from customers, despite their complaint being rejected, that my response had been prompt, helpful and jargon free.  

#### Big Picture Thinking
- Setting and adhering to business-wide polcies, with regards regulatory rules and guidlines. Analysing customer feedback to prioritise and relay key information to the business, and chairing monthly meetings with senior management to implement my suggested improvements.

#### An Eye for Detail
- Quick to spot small deviations in text that often go unnoticed. This skill was developed folowing years of proof-reading and fixing errors as part of my previous career, and has been instrumental while pairing or supporting colleagues to find bugs in their code during projects.
