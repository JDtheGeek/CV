## Overview

When my wife told her friends I was leaving my job in the finance sector to learn to code, they were surprised, as they assumed I already worked in the tech industry. I've always loved exploring new technology since I was a child writing simple programs on a [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro), building myself a new PC as a teenager, to being an early adoptor of home automation and smart assistants as an adult.

My previous career in financial services often found me going out of my way to learn new tools and technology to automate simple but time consuming daily tasks within my team. When I realised I enjoyed this aspect of my day far more than my *actual* job, I knew it was time for a career change, and decided to leave my job and apply for [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) coding bootcamp.

## Skills

#### Clear, Concise Communication
- Communicating complex ideas and concepts in plain english. This was demonstrated by thank-you letters from customers, despite their complaint being rejected, that my response had been prompt, helpful and jargon free.

#### Big Picture Thinking
- Setting and adhering to business-wide policies, with regards to regulatory rules and guidelines. Analysing customer feedback to prioritise and relay key information to the business, and chairing monthly meetings with senior management to implement my suggested improvements.

#### An Eye for Detail
- Quick to spot small deviations in text that often go unnoticed. This skill was developed following years of proof-reading and fixing errors as part of my previous career, and has been instrumental while pairing or supporting colleagues to find bugs in their code during projects.
